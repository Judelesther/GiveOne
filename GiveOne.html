				 <h1>Computer Programing 2</h1>
				
				 <p>Computer programming or coding is the composition of sequences of instructions, 
				 called programs, that computers can follow to perform tasks. It involves designing 
				 and implementing algorithms, step-by-step specifications of procedures, by writing 
				 code in one or more programming languages. Programmers typically use high-level 
				 programming languages that are more easily intelligible to humans than machine code, 
				 which is directly executed by the central processing unit. Proficient programming 
				 usually requires expertise in several different subjects, including knowledge of the 
				 application domain, details of programming languages and generic code libraries, 
				 specialized algorithms, and formal logic.</p>
